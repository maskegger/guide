title: Stata Coding Guide
description: Julian Reif, University of Illinois
---

Empirical research in economics has grown in importance thanks to improvements in computing power and the increased availability of rich datasets. Researchers  commonly estimate regressions with millions of observations derived from multiple datasets. Research teams frequently include multiple people working at different universities. Analyses employing confidential data must be performed remotely, often on a non-networked computer at a research data center. Cutting edge analyses may require thousands or millions of lines of code written in multiple languages. 

These recent developments introduce complexity and the potential for non-transparent errors. Peer review rarely evaluates code, even though code often represents the bulk of the work. Research suggests that the results from many published papers [cannot be reproduced](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/CFR-0053) from the code and data provided by the original authors. The AEA's new [data and code availability policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) aims to improve this situation by imposing professional standards for coding and documentation. Unfortunately, most researchers (myself included) received little or no training in how to write code, and there are few examples or templates showing how to organize and document a typical analysis. 

This guide describes how to set up a robust coding environment and write a "push-button" analysis in Stata. Its purpose is to help researchers:
1. Minimize coding errors
1. Automate the creation of tables and figures
1. Integrate their Stata code with supporting *R* analyses
1. Produce a replication package with the following features: 
  1. Compliant with the AEA's [data and code availability policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code)
  1. Cross-platform (Mac, Windows, Unix)
  1. Runs on a non-networked computer (no need to download add-ons)

The guide includes an accompanying AEA-compliant [sample replication package](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project) that you are free to use as a template. Try it out and see how easy (or not!) it is for you to reproduce my example analysis. If you encounter any difficulties let me know.

# Setting up your environment

I work on several projects at the same time, access them from multiple computers (laptop, home, work, etc.), and share them with multiple coauthors. Using multiple environments makes it hard to define the pathname (location) of a folder. A project's location may be **/Users/jreif/my-project** on one computer and **/Users/coauthor/my-project** on another computer. You could manually change this pathname every time a different person or different computer runs the code, but this solution is cumbersome for large projects with thousands or millions of lines of code. A better solution is to define a variable that points to the project folder.

Below I describe how I set up my working environment to address this challenge. Note that users are NOT required to do this in order to run my published code. But, setting up your environment like I do will make it easier to develop your analysis in environments with multiple computers and coauthors.

## Dropbox

I use Dropbox to sync my projects across environments. Dropbox has several appealing features. It creates backups of my projects across multiple computers and the Dropbox server, and in my experience has fewer bugs than alternatives such as Box. Dropbox makes it easy to share files with coauthors. All files stored in Dropbox have the same relative paths, which is helpful when writing scripts (more on this below).

## Stata profile

Stata automatically runs the script **profile.do** upon launch (if found).

<img src="assets/guide/stata_profile.PNG" width="100%" title="Stata profile">

**profile.do** must be stored in one of the paths searched by Stata. Type `adopath` at the Stata prompt to view a list of the eligible paths for your particular computer. On my mac, I store this file in **/Users/jreif/Documents/Stata/ado/personal/profile.do**. On my PC, I store it in **C:/ado/personal/profile.do**.

Here are the contents of the Stata profile stored on my PC:
```stata
* Settings specific to local environment
global DROPBOX "C:/Users/jreif/Dropbox"
global RSCRIPT_PATH "C:/Program Files/R/R-3.6.2/bin/x64/Rscript.exe"

* Run file containing settings common to all environments
run "$DROPBOX/stata_profile.do"
```

This file contains settings specific to my PC, namely the location of my Dropbox folder and my *R* executable (used by [rscript](https://github.com/reifjulian/rscript)). The Stata profile stored on my mac is identical except that it defines different locations for DROPBOX and RSCRIPT_PATH. I could also define the locations of all my projects in **profile.do**. But instead, I store those definitions, along with any other settings that are common across my computers, on Dropbox in a script called **stata_profile.do** and then call that script from **profile.do**.

Here are the contents of an example **stata_profile.do** stored on Dropbox:
```stata
set varabbrev off
global MyProject "$DROPBOX/research/my-project/analysis"
```

The first line, `set varabbrev off`, is a command I want executed every time I open Stata on all my computers, for reasons [I explain below](#good_coding_practice). The second line defines the location of the analysis for [MyProject](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project), which I stored on Dropbox. In practice my Stata profile defines a large number of globals, one for every project I am working on. Whenever I start a new project, I define a new global for it and add it to **stata_profile.do**. Because all my computers are synced to Dropbox, I only have to do this once.

## *R* profile

I write most of my code in Stata, including C++ plugins such as [strgroup](https://github.com/reifjulian/strgroup). On occasion, I will use an *R* function that is not available in Stata, such as [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In these cases I find it convenient to setup an *R* environment that is consistent with my Stata environment.

Similar to Stata, *R* automatically runs **.Rprofile** upon launch (if found). (More background available [here](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/3-3-r-startup.html#r-startup) if you're interested.) This file is typically stored in your home directory, whose location you can find by typing `normalizePath(path.expand("~"),winslash="/")` at the *R* prompt.

Here are the contents of my *R* profile, stored in **C:/Users/jreif/Documents/.Rprofile**:
```R
# Settings specific to local environment
Sys.setenv(DROPBOX = "C:/Users/jreif/Dropbox")

# Run file containing settings common to all environments
source(file.path(Sys.getenv("DROPBOX"), "R_profile.R"))
```

As with my Stata profile, my *R* profile in turn runs a second script located at the top level of my Dropbox directory. This file, **R_profile.R**, stores *R* settings common across all my computers, such as the paths for all my projects. Here is an example for the MyProject analysis:

```R
Sys.setenv(MyProject = file.path(Sys.getenv("DROPBOX"), "research/my-project/analysis"))
```

## Version control systems

Version control systems such as Git and SVN are powerful and absolutely necessary for large software development collaborations. I myself use GitHub when developing my [software packages](https://github.com/reifjulian/). However, I do not believe these systems are necessary for most academic analyses, in part because these analyses usually "end" after publication. If you're interested version control, I recommend checking out [Grant McDermott's Git slides](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/02-git/02-Git.html#1).


# Organizing the project

## Folder structure

A project includes lots of different parts: the analysis, the manuscript, related literature, grant proposals, etc. The analysis, which includes both code and data, should be kept in a distinct location. Keeping the analysis separate will make it easier to create a standalone replication package when the project is complete.

A typical analysis starts with raw data (e.g., a dataset downloaded from the web). Scripts process these data and then run the analysis. Scripts and data should be stored in separate folders. The core structure for my analyses looks like this:

```text
.
└── analysis/
    ├── data/
    ├── scripts/
        ├── 1_process_raw_data.do
        └── 2_...
    └── run.do		
```

The master script, **run.do**, executes the entire analysis. Running this script creates all necessary additional folders, intermediate files, and results:

```text
.
└── analysis/
    ├── data/
    ├── processed/
    ├── results/
        ├── figures/
        └── tables/
    ├── scripts/
        ├── 1_process_raw_data.do
        └── 2_...
    └── run.do		
```

At any time, you can delete **processed/** and **results/**, keeping only **data/** and **scripts/**, and then rerun your analysis from scratch. When the project is complete, a copy of **analysis/** serves as a standalone replication package.

**scripts/** includes all scripts and libraries (add-on packages) required to run the analysis. **data/** includes raw (input) data and is read-only. That is, my scripts write files only to **processed/** or **results/**.

**results/** contains all final output, including tables and figures. These can be linked to a LaTeX document on Overleaf or stored in an adjacent folder. For example, [MyProject](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project) has the following folder structure:

```text
.
└── analysis/
    ├── data/
    ├── processed/
    ├── results/
        ├── figures/
        └── tables/
    ├── scripts/
        ├── 1_process_raw_data.do
        └── 2_...
    └── run.do
└── paper/
    ├── manuscript.tex
    ├── figures/
    └── tables/
```

To update the MyProject manuscript, copy **analysis/results/figures/** and **analysis/results/tables/** to **paper/**, which contains manuscript files. Additional documents such as literature references can be stored in **paper/** or in a separate, standalone folder at the top the project directory. 

## Programs

Programs (aka functions, subroutines) are pieces of code that are called by your scripts. These might be do-files, ado-files, or scripts written in another programming language such as *R*. An introduction to ado-files is available [here](https://blog.stata.com/2015/11/10/programming-an-estimation-command-in-stata-a-first-ado-command). Because programs are not called directly by the master script, **run.do**, I usually store them in the subdirectory **scripts/programs/**. This reduces clutter in large projects with many scripts.

## Libraries

My code frequently employs user-written Stata commands, such as [regsave](https://github.com/reifjulian/regsave) or [reghdfe](http://scorreia.com/software/reghdfe/install.html). To ensure replication, it is **very important** to include copies of these programs with your code:
1. Unless a user has a local copy of the program, she won't be able to run your code if you don't supply this program.
1. These commands are updated over time and newer versions may not work with older code implementations.

Many people do not appreciate how code updates can inhibit replication. Here is an example. You perform a Stata analysis using a new, user-written estimation command called, say, `regols`. You publish your paper, along with your replication code, but do not include the code for `regols`. Ten years later a researcher tries to replicate your analysis. The code breaks because she has not installed `regols`. She opens Stata and types `ssc install regols`, which installs the newest version of that command. But, in the intervening ten years the author of `regols` fixed a bug in how the standard errors are calculated. When the researcher runs your code with her updated version of `regols` she finds your estimates are no longer statistically significant. The researcher does not know whether this happens because you included the wrong dataset with your replication, because there is mistake in the analysis code, or because you failed to correctly copy/paste your output into your publication. She cannot replicate your published results and must now decide what to conclude.

Stata takes version control [seriously](https://www.stata.com/features/integrated-version-control/). At a minimum, you should always include a `version` statement in the final version of your published code. Writing `version 15` instructs all future versions of Stata to run your code the same way Stata 15 did. (Your [master script](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/run.do) is a good place for the version statement.) Unfortunately, many user-written packages (including my own) are not carefully version controlled.  To address this, I include a script called [_install_stata_packages.do](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/scripts/_install_stata_packages.do) in all my working projects. This script installs copies of any user-written packages used by the project into a subdirectory of the project folder: **analysis/scripts/libraries/stata**. Rerunning this script will install updated versions of these add-on's (if desired). I delete this script when my project is ready to be published, which effectively locks down the code for these user-written packages and thus ensures I can exactly replicate my Stata analysis forever. In addition, including these user-written packages allows my project to be replicated on a non-networked computer that does not have access to the internet.

I am unaware of a version control statement for *R*. As a second-best solution, my replication packages include an *R* program, [_confirm_version.R](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/scripts/programs/_confirm_version.R), which checks whether the user: (1) is running a sufficiently recent version of *R*; and (2) has installed necessary add-on programs such as [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/). As with Stata, it is possible to install these add-on packages into your project subdirectory. In practice, doing this in *R* creates headaches. Add-on packages such as tidyverse are very large (hundreds of megabytes) and--if you want to ensure cross-platform replicability--need to be installed separately for Mac, Unix, and Windows. Doing this for my sample replication project would increase that project's file size by nearly a gigabyte! I therefore again settled for a second-best solution and instead require the user to install these packages themselves. As described in the projects' [README](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/README.pdf), the user can install these packages in three different ways: 
1. Manually by typing, e.g., `install.packages(“tidyverse”)` at the R prompt
1. Automatically by opening R and running [_install_R_packages.R](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/scripts/programs/_install_R_packages.R)
1. Automatically by uncommenting line 52 of [run.do](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/run.do)
 

If you don't mind potentially using up lots of disk space and want to ensure reproducibility, I highly recommend installing your *R* packages in the project subdirectory just like I did with Stata. See the commented out code in [_install_R_packages.R](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/scripts/programs/_install_R_packages.R) for an example. Following this example will result in a folder structure that looks like this:

```text
.
└── analysis/
    ├── data/
    └── scripts/
        ├── libraries/
    	    ├── R/
    	    └── stata/
        ├── programs/
        ├── 1_process_raw_data.do
        └── 2_...
    └── run.do		
```
Other alternatives--used frequently by serious users of *R*--include [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) and [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

### Stata plugins (advanced)

Most Stata add-on's are written in Stata or Mata, which are cross-platform languages that can be run on any computer with a copy of Stata. A small number of Stata add-ons are written in C/C++ and must be compiled to a plugin (aka dynamically linked library, or DLL) that is specific to your computer's architecture (Mac/PC, 32/64 bit, etc.). If you write C/C++ code for Stata, I encourage you to compile it for multiple platforms and include all platform-specific plugins as part of your replication package. See [gtools](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-gtools) and [strgroup](https://github.com/reifjulian/strgroup) for examples of how to write a program that autodetects which plugin to call based on your computer's architecture. Mauricio Bravo provides a nice [example](https://mcaceresb.github.io/stata/plugins/2017/02/15/writing-stata-plugins-example.html) of the benefits of plugins.

# Automating tables

Automating tables and figures makes it easy to incorporate updated data into your analyses and minimizes mistakes that can arise when transferring results from Stata to your manuscript. Automating figures is easy using Stata's `graph export` command. Here I provide instructions for automating tables. 

There are several ways to automate tables. Below I present my preferred method, which uses Stata add-ons I developed for prior projects. This method is targeted at people who use LaTeX and desire flexible control over their table formatting. For examples of the kinds of tables you can automate in Stata, see my paper on [workplace wellness](https://www.nber.org/workplacewellness/s/IL_Wellness_Study_1.pdf) (coauthored with Damon Jones and David Molitor). 

Automation is broken down into two steps. The first step uses [regsave](https://github.com/reifjulian/regsave) to save regression output to a file. The second step uses [texsave](https://github.com/reifjulian/texsave) to save the output in LaTeX format. In-between these two steps you can use Stata's built-in data manipulation commands to organize your table however you like.

## regsave

`regsave` is a Stata add-on that stores regression results. To install the latest version, run the following at your Stata prompt:
```stata
net install regsave, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reifjulian/regsave/master") replace
```

The [online documentation](https://github.com/reifjulian/regsave) provides a tutorial for `regsave`. Below, I show how I use it in the [sample replication package](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project). This code is a good example of how I use it in most of my analyses.

We begin by running code from the script [3_regressions.do](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/scripts/3_regressions.do):
```stata
tempfile results
use "$MyProject/processed/auto.dta", clear

local replace replace
foreach rhs in "mpg" "mpg weight" {
	
  * Domestic cars
  reg price `rhs' if foreign=="Domestic", robust
  regsave using "`results'", t p autoid `replace' addlabel(rhs,"`rhs'",origin,Domestic) 
  local replace append
	
  * Foreign cars
  reg price `rhs' if foreign=="Foreign", robust
  regsave using "`results'", t p autoid append addlabel(rhs,"`rhs'",origin,"Foreign") 		
}
```

This code estimates four different regressions and saves the results to a tempfile, `results`. Let's open that file and look at the contents.

```stata
use "`results'", clear
list
```

<img src="assets/guide/regsave.PNG" width="100%" title="Contents of results tempfile">

The file contains the regression coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, etc. from each of the four regressions. We could have saved more information, such as confidence intervals, by specifying the appropriate option. Type `help regsave` to see the full set of options. 

This output file can be easily analyzed and manipulated, but is not ideal for table presentation. We can convert this "long" table to a "wide" table using the `regsave_tbl` helper function. Here is the relevant code from [4_make_tables_figures.do](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/scripts/4_make_tables_figures.do):

```stata
tempfile my_table
use "$MyProject/results/intermediate/my_regressions.dta", clear

* Merge together the four regressions into one table
local run_no = 1
local replace replace
foreach orig in "Domestic" "Foreign" {
  foreach rhs in "mpg" "mpg weight" {
		
    regsave_tbl using "`my_table'" if origin=="`orig'" & rhs=="`rhs'", name(col`run_no') asterisk(10 5 1) parentheses(stderr) sigfig(3) `replace'
		
    local run_no = `run_no'+1
    dlocal replace append
  }
}
```

This code converts each saved regression to "wide" format, saved in the tempfile `my_table`. Let's open that tempfile and look at its contents:

```stata
use "`my_table'", clear
list
```

<img src="assets/guide/regsave_tbl.PNG" width="100%" title="Contents of my_table tempfile">

This "wide" format is much more appropriate for a table. Of course, we still need to clean it up. For example, I do not want to report t-statistics or estimates of constant term. In the next step below we will format the table and then use `texsave` to output it into a LaTeX file.

## texsave

[texsave](https://github.com/reifjulian/texsave) is a Stata add-on that saves a dataset as a LaTeX text file. To install the latest version, type the following at your Stata prompt:

```stata
net install texsave, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reifjulian/texsave/master") replace
```

We first reformat the dataset that was produced using `regsave_tbl`:

```stata
use "`my_table'", clear
drop if inlist(var,"_id","rhs","origin") | strpos(var,"_cons") | strpos(var,"tstat") | strpos(var,"pval")

* texsave will output these labels as column headers
label var col1 "Spec 1"
label var col2 "Spec 2"
label var col3 "Spec 1"
label var col4 "Spec 2"

* Display R^2 in LaTeX math mode
replace var = "\(R^2\)" if var=="r2"

* Clean variable names
replace var = subinstr(var,"_coef","",1)
replace var = "" if strpos(var,"_stderr")
replace var = "Miles per gallon"     if var=="mpg"
replace var = "Weight (pounds)"      if var=="weight"
replace var = "Price (1978 dollars)" if var=="price"

list
```

This code first removes output we don't want in our table, like t-statistics. It then labels the four columns of numbers. As we shall see, those Stata labels will later serve as column headers. The code rewrites `r2` using the LaTeX math synytax `\(R^2\)`. (This syntax is an alternative to the more common syntax `$R^2$`, which causes problems in Stata because `$` also refers to local macros.) The last part of the code provides more descriptive labels for the regressors. Typing `list` shows that our table now looks like this:

<img src="assets/guide/regsave_tbl_clean.PNG" width="100%" title="Cleaned table">

We are now ready to save the table in LaTeX format using `texsave`. We will provide a title, some additional LaTeX code for the header of the table, and a footnote:

```stata
local title "Association between automobile price and fuel efficiency"
local headerlines "& \multicolumn{2}{c}{Domestic cars} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Foreign cars} " "\cmidrule(lr){2-3} \cmidrule(lr){4-5}"
local fn "Notes: Outcome variable is price (1978 dollars). Columns (1) and (2) report estimates of \(\beta\) from equation (\ref{eqn:model}) for domestic automobiles. Columns (3) and (4) report estimates for foreign automobiles. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. A */**/*** indicates significance at the 10/5/1\% levels."
texsave using "$MyProject/results/tables/my_regressions.tex", autonumber varlabels hlines(-2) nofix replace marker(tab:my_regressions) title("`title'") headerlines("`headerlines'") footnote("`fn'")
```

We can now copy the output file, **my_regressions.tex**, to **paper/tables/** and then link to it from our LaTeX [manuscript](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/paper/my_paper.tex) with the code `\input{tables/my_regressions.tex}`. After compiling the manuscript, our table looks like this:

<img src="assets/guide/table_pdf.PNG" width="100%" title="PDF LaTeX table">

# Submission checklist

You've completed your analysis, written up your results, and are ready to submit to a journal! Before doing so, you should check that all your numbers are reproducible. If there are any mistakes in the code, better to find them now rather than later! The following steps will help ensure that anybody can reproduce all your final results:

1. Make a copy of the **analysis/** folder. For the steps below, work only with this copy. It will become your "replication package".

1. Rerun your analysis from scratch.

    - (Optional) Prior to rerunning, disable all locally installed Stata programs not located in your Stata folder. (This ensures your analysis is actually using the add-ons installed in your project subdirectory, rather than add-ons installed somewhere else on your machine.) On Windows, this can usually be done by renaming **c:/ado** to **c:/_ado**. You can test whether you succeeded as follows. Suppose you had previously installed `regsave` on your computer system. To check that it is no longer accessbily after renaming **c:/ado** to **c:/_ado**, open up a new instance of Stata and type `which regsave`. Stata should report "command regsave not found". If not, Stata will tell you where the command is located, and you can then rename that folder by adding an underscore. Repeat until Stata can no longer find `regsave`. 

    - Delete the **processed/** and **results/** folders.

    - Run **run.do** to regenerate all tables and figures using just the raw data.

1. Confirm that the reproduced output in **results/figures/** and **results/tables/** matches the results in your manuscript.

If you are publishing your paper, you should also complete the following additional steps:

{:start="4"}
1. Remove **_install_stata_packages.do** from **scripts/**.

1. Add a [README file](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/README.pdf). The README should include the following information:
  - Title and authors of the paper
  - Description of the data
  - Required software, including version numbers
  - **Clear** instructions for how to run the analysis. Inform the user if the analysis cannot actually be run (perhaps because the data are proprietary, for example).
  - Description of where the output is stored

1. (Optional) Rename the copy of your **analysis/** folder.

1. Zip (compress) the analysis folder.

1. Upload to a secure data archive.
  - The [ICPSR data enclave](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/ICPSR/access/restricted/enclave.html) is one option.

Step 4 above--checking numbers--can be tedious. Include lots of asserts in your code when writing up your results to make this process smoother. (See an example of how to use `assert` commands [here](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/scripts/4_make_tables_figures.do).) For example, if the main result of your paper is a regression estimate of $1.2 million, include an assert in your code that will fail should this number ever change following a new data update.

# Stata coding tips

Use forward slashes for pathnames (`$DROPBOX/project` not `$DROPBOX\project`). Backslashes are an escape character in Stata and can cause issues depending on what operating system you are running. Using forward slashes ensures cross-platform compatibility.

Make code readable. In addition to providing comments in the code, make your variable names meaningful (but short). Provide more detailed descriptions using the `label variable` command. Always include units in the label.

Never use hard-coded paths like **C:/Users/jreif/Dropbox/my-project**. All pathnames should reference a global variable defined either in your Stata profile or in your [master script](https://github.com/reifjulian/my-project/blob/master/analysis/run.do). I should be able to run your entire analysis from my personal computer without having to edit any of your scripts. (With the exception of maybe having to define a global variable.)

Include `set varabbrev off` in your Stata profile.  Most professional Stata programmers I know do this in order to avoid unexpected behaviors such as [this](https://www.ifs.org.uk/docs/stata_gotchasJan2014.pdf).

When working with very large datasets, install and use Mauricio Bravo's [gtools](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-gtools).

Sometimes an analysis will produce different results each time you run it. Here are two common reasons why this happens:
1. One of your commands requires random numbers and you forgot to use `set seed #`
1. You have a nonunique sort. Add `isid` checks to your code prior to sorting to ensure uniqueness. (Another option is to add the `unique` option to your sorts.) Nonunique sorts can be hard to spot:

```stata
* The random variable r here is not unique, because Stata's default type (float) does not have enough precision when N=100,000.
* isid will therefore generate an error (unless you have changed Stata's default type to double)
clear
set seed 100
set obs 100000
gen r = uniform()
isid r

* Cast r as a double to avoid this problem
clear
set seed 100
set obs 100000
gen double r = uniform()
isid r
```

I would especially like to thank my frequent collaborators Tatyana Deryugina and David Molitor for providing many helpful suggestions that have improved my project organization. I also thank Grant McDermott for several helpful conversations regarding version control and reproducibility in *R*.
